# README – Translation Projects for Border Guard Training

##  Overview
This repository contains selected fragments of **specialized training instructions** prepared for Border Guard officers.  
My role combined **interpretation, translation, and technical writing**, ensuring that training materials and live instructions were accessible to international participants.

---

##  Context
- Training sessions involved **6–8 foreign participants** from several countries, each with varying levels of English proficiency.  
- My responsibility was to **simplify and clarify the instructors’ commands** in real time, making them understandable to all participants.  
- This required not only linguistic skills but also **precise knowledge of safety procedures and technical terminology**.

##  Scope of Translation
1. **Firearms Training (Glock 17)**  
   - Accurate translation of safety procedures and shooting instructions.  
   - Real-time interpretation during live exercises.  

2. **Pyrotechnic Robot Operation**  
   - Translation of documentation for equipment worth over **1 million PLN**.  
   - Clear communication of technical steps and safety protocols.  

3. **Polygraph Operation**  
   - Translation of procedures and scientific explanations.  
   - Emphasis on the importance of accuracy in investigative contexts.  

4. **Drug Testing Procedures**  
   - Translation of reagent-based identification methods.  
   - My background in environmental protection supported precise terminology for chemical processes.

##  Challenges
- **Real-time interpretation** under pressure, ensuring clarity and safety.  
- **Simplification of complex procedures** for participants with only basic English knowledge.  
- **Balancing technical accuracy with accessibility**, especially in high-risk contexts (firearms, explosives, chemical reagents).  

---

##  Outcome
- Training materials were successfully translated and adapted for international participants.  
- Real-time interpretation enabled smooth communication between instructors and trainees.  
- The project demonstrates my ability to combine **translation, technical writing, and subject-matter expertise** in demanding, safety-critical environments.
